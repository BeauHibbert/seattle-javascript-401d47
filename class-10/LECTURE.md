# Stacks and Queues

## Review

Linked List:  Linear Collection of Nodes (where each successive node points to its next).  leans towards O(n) time and same for space if anything is created

## Stack Data Structure

Stack: FILO (first in last out).  
  - Stack properties: top
  - Node properties: value, next
  - Traverse:  starting at the top and follow the next pointers
  


### Use Cases:

- reversing thing:  First thing in will be last thing out


## Queue Data Structure

Queue:  FIFO (first in first out). 
  Queue properties: 
  Node properties: value, next
  Traverse: starting at the front and follow the next pointers

### Use Cases:

- need to process things in a FIFO order
