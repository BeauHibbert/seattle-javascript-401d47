# S3 and Lambda

## Code Review

Thoughts...

## Warm-up

Reverse a Linked List - Nice job Brady

## Review

#### EC2

VIRTUAL MACHINE - where we can setup an environment of our choosing

#### Elastic Beanstalk

opinionated service that allows us to deploy and manage our application

## Serverless Architecture

Serverless => a lot more servers -> no more big monolithic servers that handle handle all the things...  but small servers that handle single specific tasks

why?!  on demand, servable logic.  maintainable.  "micro service"  

### Lambda

What specifically is a Lambda?  A function (with specific syntax)  

what is this:  `=>`?  Fat Arrow.  Arrow from arrow function.  ALSO:  Lambda

- Ben: "scriptlet" (aka function - following single responsibility principal)

### S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Bucket

Object Storage.  files. images, videos, text files, variables
Data Storage:  

Databases are great for "scalar" values
- strings
- numbers
- objects with params
- booleans

s3:
images / videos / text files
also have some of those scalar items too...  maybe in a doc?  maybe useful

programmatically:
- upload
- read
- update
- maintain a repository of documents
- just store it in the "bucket(s)"
