# Context Behaviors

## Review

Lab-31 Questions:

- pagination
  - page - state variable starting at 0
  - pages array - based on the items length and the number of items per page
  - nav bar or pagination bar with blueprint, maybe a map of the array rendering buttons - not sure
- creating context
  - 2 items in use, 3rd is added and not used (I believe)
- useForm() hook
