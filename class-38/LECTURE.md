## Review

Lab-37 

- separating reducers and redux state
    - categories
    - products
    - active category
- cart state updates:
    - cart itself - its own reducer. 
    - actions touch multiple reducers
    - inventory decrement (or increment on removal) products

## Today's Lab

use the api-server:

`https://api-js401.herokuapp.com/api/v1/`

- the above API has `/categories` and `/products` endpoints
