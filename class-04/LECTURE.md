- Abdi:  yesterday was tough.  postgres not playing nice. May have a Remo-level crash course on making work `with sqlite::memory`  run nodemon and use thunderClient
- Brady: (how) do we / can we get proof of life with ThunderClient?
- Andrew: maybe  we can go over a route - tested with ThunderClient
