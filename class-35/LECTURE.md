# Graphs

### What Are Graphs?

- data structure that holds nodes or vertices

- essentially all the other data structures, may or may not follow their rules.  

### Terminology:
- Direction: When an edge points from one node to another
- Node / Vertex:  our container for the "value"
- Edge:  connection between edges.  Contains references between nodes
- Degree:  Property of a node:  how many edges a node has
- A-cyclical:  does NOT loop via edges
- Cyclical:  DOES loop via edges - aka can hit same vertex more than once  while traversing
- Neighbors:  node / vertex connected by an edge (think next in linkedList, or right or left in BinaryTree)
